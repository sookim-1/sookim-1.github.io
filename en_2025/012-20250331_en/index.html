The candidates included the <code>http</code> package, a combination of Dio + Retrofit, and Chopper. After team discussion, we decided to proceed with the default <code>http</code> package and consider switching during future refactoring.</p><p>When it came to state management, we had to choose between the Provider and RiverPod packages. Since RiverPod is an improvement over Provider and actually includes it, we decided to use Provider for now. This approach helps us identify limitations and understand RiverPod better.</p><h3>üöò Pleos25</h3><hr /><p>I attended a developer conference hosted by Hyundai Motor Company called <a href="https://devcon.hyundaimotorgroup.com/2025">Pleos25</a>.</p><p>What is Pleos? It‚Äôs the name of the OS running inside vehicles, which also has its own app marketplace. Developers can build infotainment apps for the vehicle and launch them, making them accessible directly inside the car.</p><p>Several SDKs for vehicle control and real-time vehicle-related information (e.g., Fleet API) were released in beta on the same day. There was a session where attendees could try simple development using these services. Once officially released and regulatory constraints are eased, this could have a significant impact on the mobility and in-vehicle app markets.</p><h3>üë®‚Äçüéì Inflearn Knowledge Sharing Challenge - 1st Round</h3><hr /><p>Inflearn defines lecture creators as ‚Äúknowledge sharers.‚Äù Therefore, creating a course is referred to as ‚Äúsharing knowledge.‚Äù I joined the first round of the Knowledge Sharing Challenge, which helps new creators get started. I plan to create an introductory iOS app development course through this challenge.</p><ul><li><a href="%5B%3Chttps://www.inflearn.com/course/offline/%EC%9D%B8%ED%94%84%EB%9F%B0-%EC%A7%80%EC%8B%9D%EA%B3%B5%EC%9C%A0-%EC%B1%8C%EB%A6%B0%EC%A7%80-1%EA%B8%B0?srsltid=AfmBOoq6-MKgLli_n34B5TnLgtqeoGRwitZ87hjsd9sTjTrB9b4aahhc%3E%5D(%3Chttps://www.inflearn.com/course/offline/%EC%9D%B8%ED%94%84%EB%9F%B0-%EC%A7%80%EC%8B%9D%EA%B3%B5%EC%9C%A0-%EC%B1%8C%EB%A6%B0%EC%A7%80-1%EA%B8%B0?srsltid=AfmBOoq6-MKgLli_n34B5TnLgtqeoGRwitZ87hjsd9sTjTrB9b4aahhc%3E)">Introduction to the Knowledge Sharing Challenge</a></li></ul><p>In the first session held at the Pangyo campus, we learned how to select a lecture topic using tools like Google Trends and by reviewing which lectures are currently popular.</p><p>The challenge greatly helped me in deciding my course topic. I had been debating between starting with an introductory or intermediate-level course. Starting with an introductory course has the following benefits:</p><ol><li>It helps promote future courses to students who already took the beginner course.</li><li>It builds confidence in explaining the content during production, as it‚Äôs more straightforward than intermediate-level material.</li></ol><h3>üßÆ Efficient and Reliable iOS Code Design: Functional & Declarative Programming Paradigm - Week 1</h3><hr /><p>I started attending an offline course offered by Fast Campus, which runs for five weeks and focuses on designing efficient and reliable iOS code using functional and declarative programming paradigms.</p><ul><li><a href="https://fastcampus.co.kr/dev_camp_functional">Course Introduction</a></li></ul><p><strong>Summary of Week 1</strong></p><p>Functional Programming Concepts</p><ul><li>Functional programming emerged around the 1950s. While object-oriented programming has been dominant, interest in functional programming has grown recently due to the rise of parallel programming.</li><li>The core feature of functional programming is immutability‚Äîit guarantees that data does not change. In other words, given an input, the output from a function remains unaffected by external side effects. This is achieved using pure functions.</li><li>Although Swift is not a purely functional language, it supports first-class functions, higher-order functions, and closures, allowing partial application of functional programming principles.</li></ul><h3>üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Other Notes</h3><hr /><ol><li>I compared the Tmap REST API and INavi REST API, which are frequently used in mobility services. A flexible approach would be to define the app‚Äôs internal models and convert the DTOs returned by each 3rd-party API accordingly. Also, defining behavior and interactions using protocols per API would help keep the structure clean.<ul><li><a href="https://tmapapi.tmapmobility.com/main.html#webservice/docs/tmapPoiSearch">Tmap Place (POI) Search</a> - <a href="https://mapsapi.inavisys.com/web-integrated-search">INavi Integrated Search</a></li><li><a href="https://tmapapi.tmapmobility.com/main.html#webservice/docs/reverseGeocoding">Tmap Reverse Geocoding</a> - <a href="https://mapsapi.inavisys.com/web-reverse-geo-coding">INavi Reverse Geocoding</a></li><li><a href="https://tmapapi.tmapmobility.com/main.html#webservice/docs/tmapRouteDoc">Tmap Driving Route Guide</a> - <a href="https://mapsapi.inavisys.com/web-route-normal">INavi Route Search</a></li><li><a href="https://tmapapi.tmapmobility.com/main.html#webservice/docs/tmapRoutePredictionDoc">Tmap Time Machine Driving Guide</a> - <a href="https://mapsapi.inavisys.com/web-route-time">INavi Route Prediction</a></li></ul></li></ol></p><div><h3><a href="/tags/i-o-s" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">iOS</span></a><a href="/tags/swift" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Swift</span></a><a href="/tags/flutter" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Flutter</span></a><a href="/tags/seminar" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Seminar</span></a><a href="/tags/online-lecture" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Online Lecture</span></a><a href="/tags/functional-programming" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Functional Programming</span></a><a href="/tags/tmap" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Tmap</span></a><a href="/tags/inavi" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Inavi</span></a></h3></div></div><script src="/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script></body></html>
