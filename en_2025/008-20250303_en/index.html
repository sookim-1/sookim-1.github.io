However, no alert was being displayed.</p><p>Therefore, I assumed the issue originated from the Naver Map SDK and inquired about it on the <a href="https://www.ncloud-forums.com/forum/10/">Naver Map Forum</a>.</p><p>The response suggested referring to the authentication failure section in the <a href="https://navermaps.github.io/ios-map-sdk/guide-ko/1.html">Naver Map documentation</a>. Although the documentation is detailed, I had overlooked it because there was no specific mention of 510 or timeout errors.</p><p>Next time, instead of just assuming a network issue when encountering a timeout, I should also consider where the <code>UIAlertController</code> is being displayed.</p><h3>üìç CoreLocation Framework</h3><hr /><p>In iOS, the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation">CoreLocation</a> framework is used to obtain the current location.</p><p>To determine the current location, multiple components such as Wi-Fi, Cellular, GPS, Bluetooth (iBeacon), magnetometer, and barometer are used to collect data.</p><p>Since CoreLocation has been available since iOS 2, it has undergone numerous updates.</p><p>Accessing location data requires requesting user permissions, which have changed over time. Permissions such as ‚ÄúAlways Allow,‚Äù ‚ÄúPrecise Location,‚Äù and ‚ÄúAllow Once‚Äù need to be reviewed based on the iOS version.</p><p>To simplify permission requests, UIKit and SwiftUI provide CoreLocationUI framework buttons.</p><p>Additionally, to improve asynchronous processing and background handling, <code>CLLocationUpdate</code> and <code>CLMonitor</code> were introduced in iOS 17 as wrappers for <code>CLLocationManager</code>.</p><p>To enhance location accuracy, we can refer to the <code>accuracy</code> value or specify the <code>Activity Type</code> based on movement type before requesting location access.</p><p>Here are some recommended blogs related to CoreLocation:</p><ul><li><a href="https://yahoth.tistory.com/21">Thoughts on Location Data Accuracy</a></li><li><a href="https://twocentstudios.com/2024/12/02/core-location-modern-api-tips/">Core Location Modern API Tips</a></li></ul><h3>‚öôÔ∏è RIBs Architecture Framework</h3><hr /><p>I visited the <a href="https://github.com/uber/RIBs">RIBs</a> GitHub repository to study the framework. Since RIBs is a cross-platform architecture framework, it was previously available for both Android and iOS in a single repository, but it has now been separated into <a href="https://github.com/uber/ribs-ios">RIBs-iOS</a> for each OS.</p><p>The tutorial is well-organized in the Wiki, so I was excited to follow it. However, due to incorrect project paths and version settings after the repository change, the build failed.</p><p>To resolve this, I forked the repository, fixed the paths and versioning issues, documented the build errors and solutions, and submitted a <a href="https://github.com/uber/RIBs-iOS/pull/1">PR</a>. Afterward, I proceeded with the tutorial on my branch.</p><p>One concern I had was the increasing number of files. However, RIBs provides a file template that automatically generates Router, Interactor, and Builder files. Additionally, it supports the creation of Viewless RIBs.</p><p>The most intriguing feature was the ability to create a Viewless RIB, allowing it to attach child RIBs dynamically. I plan to summarize my findings as I progress.</p><p>If you want to learn RIBs, I recommend the open-source project <a href="https://github.com/eunjin3786/SimpleMemo-RIBs">SimpleMemo-RIBs</a> and Nosujin‚Äôs Fastcampus lecture.</p><h3>üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Other Notes</h3><hr /><ol><li>As the number of users increased, various Crashlytics cases were observed.<ol><li>Network response time should always be considered in processing.</li><li>When using FSCalendar, selecting a date outside the <code>minimumDate</code> and <code>maximumDate</code> range in code causes a crash.</li></ol></li><li>I discovered an open-source project called <a href="https://github.com/AaronFeng753/Waifu2x-Extension-GUI?tab=readme-ov-file">waifu2x</a> for improving image quality.</li><li>I found <a href="https://wikidocs.net/275987">Wikidocs</a>, a website that provides free books for developers through weekly draws. This could be helpful for accessing necessary books.</li><li>I searched for ways to organize App Store reviews in one place and found services like <a href="https://appfollow.io/">AppFollow</a> and the open-source scraper <a href="https://github.com/cowboy-bebug/app-store-scraper">app-store-scraper</a>, which extracts review data from the App Store.<pre><code class="language-python"> from apple_store_scraper import AppStore
