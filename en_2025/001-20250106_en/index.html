Since Flutter supports cross-platform development, I had to install both Android Studio and Xcode. While I am very familiar with Xcode, setting up Android Studio was straightforward but somewhat new to me.</p><p>As an iOS developer, my impression of Flutter is that its approach to views and widgets feels quite similar to SwiftUI. For example, HStack corresponds to Row, and VStack to Column. Dart also has similarities to Swift, making it feel somewhat familiar.</p><p>In Flutter, what‚Äôs referred to as a ‚Äúwidget‚Äù can be understood as a ‚Äúview‚Äù in iOS development, which helped me get comfortable with the framework.</p><p>My plan for continued Flutter learning includes exploring various widgets and their usage, understanding architectural patterns, and comparing these with SwiftUI to enhance my development skills.</p></p><div><h3><a href="/tags/i-o-s" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">iOS</span></a><a href="/tags/swift" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Swift</span></a><a href="/tags/blog" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Blog</span></a><a href="/tags/retrospective" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Retrospective</span></a><a href="/tags/dart" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Dart</span></a><a href="/tags/flutter" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Flutter</span></a></h3></div></div><script src="/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script></body></html>
