(Therefore, when using multiple packages, you need to consider issues such as version conflicts or unsupported packages.)</li><li>Development productivity is high. (Hot Reload and Hot Restart allow you to instantly check your code, and the declarative UI style is convenient.)</li><li>Although there are some unstable aspects such as memory management and background communication, overall, it worked well.</li></ol><h3>üßÆ Efficient and Stable iOS Code Architecture: Functional & Declarative Programming Paradigm - Session 3</h3><hr /><p>I started attending a 5-week offline course hosted by FastCampus on efficient and stable iOS code architecture. The course focuses on functional and declarative programming paradigms.</p><ul><li><a href="https://fastcampus.co.kr/dev_camp_functional">Course Introduction Link</a></li></ul><p><strong>Summary of Session 3</strong></p><ul><li>Declarative architecture declares <em>what</em> should be done, and delegates <em>how</em> it is performed to the system in an automated manner.</li><li>Comparison of programming styles:<ul><li>Imperative: procedural, object-oriented (command-focused)</li><li>Declarative: functional, logical (intent-focused)</li></ul></li></ul><h3>‚õìÔ∏è MCP</h3><hr /><p>MCP (Model Context Protocol) has been gaining attention recently, so I looked into it. MCP is a standardized communication protocol that allows AI models to be easily integrated into various applications.</p><p>It was developed by <a href="https://www.anthropic.com/">Anthropic</a>, the company behind the Claude model, and is described in detail at <a href="https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/agents-and-tools/mcp">this link</a>.Although it was introduced a while ago, it has recently gained popularity as it became integrated with tools like Cursor and the Claude app.</p><p>Since MCP is a standard communication protocol, various MCPs exist. You can browse available MCPs using MCP marketplaces.</p><ul><li><a href="https://smithery.ai/">Smithery MCP Marketplace</a></li></ul><p>Among the many MCPs, I tried using GitHub MCP and Figma MCP via Cursor.</p><ul><li>With GitHub MCP, I was able to register issues and create pull requests directly through chat in Cursor, which was very convenient.</li><li>For Figma MCP, I tried both Figma-Context-MCP and cursor-talk-to-figma-mcp. I could either design directly in Figma or convert frames in Figma to code. The conversion quality was far better than the results from providing just images.</li><li><a href="https://apidog.com/kr/blog/figma-mcp/">Figma MCP Overview</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.cursor.com/context/model-context-protocol#configuring-mcp-servers">Cursor MCP Setup Guide</a></li></ul><p>Additionally, you can configure appropriate Cursor rules to achieve even better results.</p><ul><li><a href="https://medium.com/delightroom/cursor-ios-%EA%B0%9C%EB%B0%9C%ED%99%98%EA%B2%BD-%EC%84%B8%ED%8C%85-8625f3aa732a">iOS - Cursor Rules</a></li><li><a href="https://cursor.directory/flutter-cursor-rules">Flutter - Cursor Rules</a></li></ul></p><div><h3><a href="/tags/i-o-s" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">iOS</span></a><a href="/tags/swift" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Swift</span></a><a href="/tags/flutter" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Flutter</span></a><a href="/tags/functional-programming" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Functional Programming</span></a><a href="/tags/m-c-p" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">MCP</span></a><a href="/tags/cursor" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Cursor</span></a></h3></div></div><script src="/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script></body></html>
