I am currently evaluating other OCR libraries, and NHN’s CreditCardOCR seemed to perform better.</p><p>While using this library, I found a typo in the property naming of the ViewController responsible for card recognition, so I submitted a 🔗<a href="https://github.com/nhn/nhncloud.ios.sdk/pull/5"><strong>PR</strong></a>.</p><h3>🚀 Skip</h3><hr /><p>In the mobile app market, Android and iOS are the two most popular operating systems.</p><p>Supporting only one platform means giving up users of the other OS. Cross-platform development allows for easier support of both.</p><p>While there are various cross-platform technologies such as Flutter and React Native, a new technology called KMP (Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile) has emerged, allowing development with Kotlin. In a similar vein, 🔗<a href="https://skip.tools/"><strong>Skip</strong></a> allows development using Swift, so I looked into it.</p><p>Skip is still in development and hasn’t released version 1.0 yet, but it is currently free to use.</p><p>The principle behind it is that Swift code is converted to Kotlin, and SwiftUI is converted to Compose before compilation, ensuring a truly native transformation.</p><p>You need to use Swift and SwiftUI, and it’s not recommended to migrate an existing project. Instead, creating a new Skip project is recommended.</p><p>Using Firebase or third-party libraries was cumbersome, and many errors occurred with type inference. It seems impractical for live services, but it could be useful for simple apps.</p><p>Here’s how easy it is to get started:</p><ol><li>Install Skip - <code>$brew install skiptools/skip/skip</code></li><li>Check Skip installation - <code>$skip checkup</code></li><li>Create a Skip project - <code>$skip init --appid=bundle.id project-name AppName</code></li></ol><p>Start working from the generated project’s <code>ContentView</code>.</p><h3>🌈 Design System</h3><hr /><p>A design system is a collection of reusable components, tokens, and design standards created to enhance the speed of UI implementation for both designers and software engineers. To unify the use of custom views, I began developing a design system.</p><p>Before starting, I researched various DS implementations to increase reusability.</p><p>The most helpful references were Skyscanner’s DS and a DS from a club at Soongsil University. Both open-source systems provided samples, and the Soongsil DS even offered a Figma file.</p><h3>🙋🏻‍♂️ Other Notes</h3><hr /><ol><li>I encountered a delay when handling animations in <code>viewDidAppear</code>, causing the screen to stutter. Since <code>viewDidAppear</code> is called after the view is fully visible, I moved the animation handling to <code>viewWillAppear</code>, which solved the issue.</li><li>I modified the workflow for posting on my GitHub blog, automating document formatting by receiving additional input values when the action starts.</li><li>I found a useful property wrapper that triggers whenever the view changes, called 🔗<a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/invalidating"><strong>UIView.Invalidating</strong></a>.</li></ol></p><div><h3><a href="/tags/i-o-s" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">iOS</span></a><a href="/tags/swift" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Swift</span></a><a href="/tags/design-system" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Design System</span></a><a href="/tags/view-controller-life-cycle" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">ViewController LifeCycle</span></a><a href="/tags/skip" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Skip</span></a><a href="/tags/k-m-p" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">KMP</span></a><a href="/tags/blog" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Blog</span></a><a href="/tags/o-c-r" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">OCR</span></a><a href="/tags/property-wrapper" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Property Wrapper</span></a><a href="/tags/vision" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Vision</span></a><a href="/tags/vision-kit" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Vision Kit</span></a></h3></div></div><script src="/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script></body></html>
