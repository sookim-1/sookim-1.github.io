He thought the end of a developer‚Äôs career is becoming a CTO.</li><li>While focusing on one domain is good, he said experiencing various domains to broaden your perspective is also beneficial, and experiencing traffic increase is very helpful.</li></ol></p><div><h3><a href="/tags/i-o-s" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill"style="margin-right: 5px">iOS</span></a><a href="/tags/swift" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill"style="margin-right: 5px">Swift</span></a><a href="/tags/screen-capture" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill"style="margin-right: 5px">Screen Capture</span></a><a href="/tags/interview" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill"style="margin-right: 5px">Interview</span></a></h3></div></div><script src="/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script></body></html>
