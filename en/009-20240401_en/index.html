Therefore, I think this feature is mainly convenient for projects with shorter build times.</p><p>This feature is commonly used in SwiftUI, and although there is a method for using it in UIKit, it requires adopting a protocol and implementing it, leading to the inconvenience of adding code every time a new project is created.</p><p>Starting from iOS 17, you can use Swift Macro functionality to easily utilize this feature in UIKit as well, which I organized on my <a href="https://sookim-1.tistory.com/3">blog</a>.</p><h3>üòÖ systemLayoutSizeFitting</h3><hr /><p>When the footer of a UITableView changes based on status, the height of the footer must be dynamically adjusted. Therefore, I used the method <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiview/1622623-systemlayoutsizefitting">systemLayoutSizeFitting(_:withHorizontalFittingPriority:verticalFittingPriority:)</a> to return the optimal size and determine the height, but I encountered an issue where the content area was being cut off.</p><p>The reason is that while it is possible to calculate the optimal size even when only the targetSize is specified, I set the parameter values for the vertical constraints to obtain a more accurate size.</p><h3>üîî Notification Service Extension</h3><hr /><p>By default, iOS can receive remote notifications through APNs to display push notifications.</p><p>Thus, when sending to APNs, you provide the necessary settings and information in the payload.</p><p>I wanted to implement a feature that groups notifications by type and removes previous notifications when a new one arrives. I checked if this could be applied using an extension, but I found that this task can only be done through payload settings when the server delivers data.</p><p>Upon learning this, I explored the tasks that can be performed using <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationserviceextension">Service Extension</a>.</p><ul><li>Cases where you can modify the content of remote notifications:<ul><li>Decrypting the data sent in an encrypted format.</li><li>Downloading images or other media attachments that exceed the maximum payload size.</li><li>Integrating data from the user‚Äôs device to update the content of the notification.</li></ul></li></ul><p>In summary, it is responsible for changing the content delivered to the alert (changing text and adding images).</p><h3>üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Other Notes</h3><hr /><ol><li>I am organizing all writings, except for blog posts, in my personal Notion. Since my Notion account was created with a Naver email due to student verification, I no longer need to use it. I am in the process of migrating all pages to my Gmail account. Additionally, to manage the pages more conveniently, I utilized Notion‚Äôs database feature to create my own templates for organization.</li><li>I looked at the Hyundai Card iOS app, which has a card-swiping UI, to explore how it is implemented. Among the related libraries, I found <a href="https://github.com/JoniVR/VerticalCardSwiper">VerticalCardSwiper</a>. I reviewed the code of this library to see how it was implemented.</li><li>In finance and card apps, the app screen may get obscured when going to the background, so I looked into how this is implemented. I found that there is a state defined for when the app is brought up in the App Switcher.</li></ol></p><div><h3><a href="/tags/i-o-s" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill"style="margin-right: 5px">iOS</span></a><a href="/tags/swift" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill"style="margin-right: 5px">Swift</span></a><a href="/tags/notification-service-extension" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill"style="margin-right: 5px">Notification Service Extension</span></a><a href="/tags/remote-notification" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill"style="margin-right: 5px">Remote Notification</span></a><a href="/tags/app-switcher" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill"style="margin-right: 5px">App Switcher</span></a><a href="/tags/system-layout-size-fitting" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill"style="margin-right: 5px">systemLayoutSizeFitting</span></a><a href="/tags/vertical-card-swiper" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill"style="margin-right: 5px">VerticalCardSwiper</span></a><a href="/tags/notion" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill"style="margin-right: 5px">Notion</span></a><a href="/tags/preview" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill"style="margin-right: 5px">Preview</span></a></h3></div></div><script src="/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script></body></html>
