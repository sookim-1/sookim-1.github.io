However, Sentry is also a great tool for logging crashes on the server.</p><p>Upon reviewing Sentry, I found that it offers a wide variety of options, including detailed reasons for crashes, screenshots at the time of the crash, and correlations with views.</p><h3>🛫 CI/CD</h3><hr /><p>What is Firebase App Distribution? It is a service that allows you to distribute app files and download and test the app using that service. It is similar to Apple’s TestFlight, but since Android cannot use TestFlight, App Distribution is available for both Android and iOS.</p><p>To use it on iOS, you must download the AppTester app. However, you cannot download the app directly; it is available via a website shortcut. My impression of using it on iOS is that the speed seems faster than TestFlight, but it appears to have a complex initial setup involving profile settings and device registrations. Therefore, for projects that do not plan to distribute on Android, I think I will often prefer the more accessible TestFlight.</p><p>I modified the deployment task using the Slack Slash command I created two weeks ago to trigger the Bitbucket pipeline with Jenkins, so I studied Jenkins. However, to run the pipeline in Jenkins, the machine must be a Mac.</p><h3>🙋🏻‍♂️ Other Notes</h3><hr /><ol><li>The Naver Map SDK has a feature that restricts the camera area, preventing movement outside the designated map area.</li><li>In the past, FCM tokens could be manually reissued through provided code, but according to the current official documentation, manual reissuance is no longer recommended.</li><li>Always check for memory release when progressing with tasks in the project.</li></ol></p><div><h3><a href="/tags/dart" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Dart</span></a><a href="/tags/flutter" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Flutter</span></a><a href="/tags/i-o-s" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">iOS</span></a><a href="/tags/swift" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Swift</span></a><a href="/tags/sentry" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Sentry</span></a><a href="/tags/legacy" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Legacy</span></a><a href="/tags/firebase" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">Firebase</span></a><a href="/tags/naver-map" rel="tag"><span class="badge text-bg-primary rounded-pill" style="margin-right: 5px">NaverMap</span></a></h3></div></div><script src="/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script></body></html>
